    "## Interview\n",
    "A DS/A interview consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "ALWAYS understand the problem first!\n",
    "- What are some naive examples?\n",
    "- What data structure(s) are used in this problem?\n",
    "    - Is it just a 1D array/string?\n",
    "    - Does it specify the data structure (e.g., Tree)?\n",
    "    - Does the problem involve relations between entities (Graph)?\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "- What algorithm pattern(s) can be applied to this problem?\n",
    "    - Are we trying to find something in a sequence (Binary Search)?\n",
    "    - Is the problem recursive (DFS & BFS)?\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "- By the end of this stage, you should have a rough idea of how to approach this problem.\n",
    "    - If you don't, you are dead. Go home. Grind leetcode.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASK clarification questions!\n",
    "- Confirm the **TYPE & ROLE & DIMENSION** of EACH element in EACH **input & output**.\n",
    "- Is the input guaranteed to be **VALID**?\n",
    "- Is the input **SORTED**?\n",
    "- Is the input **UNIQUE**?\n",
    "- What's the input **RANGE**?\n",
    "- Is the output a **full structure** or just some **counter**?\n",
    "- Construct **edge cases**, which can be used as test cases later.\n",
    "- Draw a **PAIR OF EXAMPLES** (positive & negative) to the interviewer to confirm your understanding.\n",
    "    - These examples shall be **specific, sufficiently large, mediocre**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "ALWAYS **COMMUNICATE** with your interviewer!\n",
    "- State **Brute-Force** first. Talk about its time & space.\n",
    "- Do NOT code YET.\n",
    "- Optimize BUDs in naive solution: **Bottlenecks, Unnecessary work, Duplicated work**.\n",
    "- Look for any **unused info**. Use it!\n",
    "- Do NOT code YET.\n",
    "- **Walk through** your entire approach in detail with the interviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When stuck,\n",
    "- Use **HashMap**!\n",
    "- Try to solve for **base cases**.\n",
    "- Try to solve **subproblems**.\n",
    "- Try other DS/As.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure\n",
    "Identify which data structures are potentially useful.\n",
    "- Storage:\n",
    "    - **Array**: store index-specific values.\n",
    "    - **HashSet**: store unique values, ignore duplicates, reduce search time to $ O(1) $.\n",
    "    - **HashMap**: store mapping of 2 different entities (e.g., `defaultdict(list), defaultdict(set), Counter()`)\n",
    "- Process:\n",
    "    - **Stack**: process things backward (DFS).\n",
    "    - **Queue**: process things forward (BFS).\n",
    "    - **Heap**: store & sort, find min/max at each step.\n",
    "- Question-specific:\n",
    "    - **LinkedList**: (I personally suck at it. FML if I get asked about this.)\n",
    "    - **Tree**: DFS & BFS, sometimes Trie.\n",
    "    - **Graph**: involve relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The single most powerful trick for any non-specific question is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>Use <strong>HashMap</strong> when in doubt.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implement & Test\n",
    "- Walk through your code on your own.\n",
    "- Modify unusual parts.\n",
    "- Check null nodes.\n",
    "- Test small mediocre cases.\n",
    "- Test edge cases.\n",
    "- Test special cases.\n",
    "- Fix bugs whenever necessary.\n",
    "- Be ready to discuss time & space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array\n",
    "### Two Pointer\n",
    "#### Left & Right\n",
    "**Where**: bi-directional, often on 1d array/string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**:\n",
    "1. left & right pointers (either facing from both ends, or expanding from middle).\n",
    "2. Loop. Break when meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Sort when necessary!\n",
    "- Use WHILE loop to go over elems that do not break condition.\n",
    "- 3-pointer (or more) is always an option.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Slow & Fast (Sliding Window)\n",
    "**Where**: uni-directional, 1d subarray/substring problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**:\n",

    "3. MIN:\n",
