    "For each model, specify:\n",
    "- Why: Motivation\n",

    "## Production\n",
    "Performance can degrade in production due to:\n",
    "- **Data Drift**: Production data $\\neq$ training data.\n",
    "- **Feature Drift**: Changes in features or feature transformations.\n",
    "- **Concept Drift**: Changes in the relationship between features & target variables, especially in a dynamic environment.\n",
    "- **Data Quality**: Missing values, outliers, noise, etc.\n",
    "- **Model Versioning**: R&D models $\\neq$ deployed models.\n",
    "- **Scaling & Latency**: Handling large data volumes and fast response times.\n",
    "- **Ethics**: Adversarial attacks, privacy concerns, regulatory compliance, interpretability, etc.\n",
    "- **Others**: Random errors (e.g., network issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these factors for production:\n",
    "1. **Inference location**:\n",
    "    - **Local**: High memory/storage usage, low latency.\n",
    "    - **Server**: Low memory/storage usage, high latency, privacy concerns.\n",
    "2. **Feature serving**:\n",
    "    - **Batch**: Handled offline, served online with periodic data generation/collection.\n",
    "    - **Real-time**: Handled & served online at request time, prioritize scalability & latency, use feature stores and caching.\n",
    "3. **Performance Monitoring**: Errors, latency, biases, data drift, CPU load, memory usage, retrain frequency, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online A/B Testing\n",
    "1. **Define Objective**: Improve click-through rates, increase sign-up rates, etc.\n",
    "    - **Significance level** $(\\alpha)$: Threshold for statistical significance.\n",
    "        - $\\alpha=P(FP)$ (i.e., Type I error): Probability of rejecting a true $H_0$.\n",
    "        - Common values: 0.05, 0.01.\n",
    "        - Lower $\\alpha$ makes difference detection harder.\n",
    "    - **Power** $(1-\\beta)$: Probability of rejecting a false $H_0$.\n",
    "        - $\\beta=P(FN)$ (i.e., Type II error): Probability of not rejecting a false $H_0$.\n",
    "        - Common value: 80%.\n",
    "        - Higher power requires larger sample size.\n",
    "2. **Create Variations**: Generate versions to test (e.g., button designs: blue round (**control**) vs green square (**treatment**)).\n",
    "3. **Calculate Traffic**: Calculate required sample size per variation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m=2\\times\\left(\\frac{Z_{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}+Z_{\\beta}}{\\text{MDE}}\\right)^2\\times p(1-p)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    - **Baseline conversion rate** ($p$): Event occurrence rate in control.\n",
    "    - **Minimum Detectable Effect** ($\\text{MDE}$): Smallest detectable difference.\n",
    "        - e.g., For $p$=10% and desired 2% improvement, $\\text{MDE}$=20%.\n",
    "        - Ensure both groups are statistically similar.\n",
    "4. **Splitting**: Randomly assign users to control and treatment.\n",
    "    - **User-level**: Users consistently see the same variation.\n",
    "        - Pros: Useful for long-term impact, reduces bias.\n",
    "    - **Request-level**: Randomly determine variation per user request.\n",
    "        - Pros: Useful for short-term impact, captures immediate or session-specific impact of the tested variations.\n",
    "5. **Measurement & Analysis**:\n",
    "    1. Track user interactions & conversions for both groups.\n",
    "    2. Compare performance using statistical analysis.\n",
    "    3. Determine if differences are statistically significant."
