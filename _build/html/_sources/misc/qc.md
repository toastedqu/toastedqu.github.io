# Quantum Probability Theory
## Motivation
3 traditions of probability theory in cognition:
- Classical/Bayesian (CPT)
- Heuristics & Biases Toolbox
- Quantum (QPT)



Why CPT fails:
- **Conjunction Fallacy**: We perceive $ P(A,B)>P(A) $ (e.g., Linda)
- **Disjunction Fallacy**: We perceive $ P(A\cup B)<P(A) $ (e.g., Linda)
- **Uncertainty Aversion**: We act in the opposite way of the **sure-thing principle** - If under each possible state of the world one always prefers action $ A$ over $B$, then one should prefer action $A$ over $B $ even when the state of the world is unknown.
    - In reality, one tends to prefer $ B$ over $A $ instead. (e.g., Prisoner's Dilemma)
- **Order Effects in Judgment** (Noncommutativity): We perceive $ P(A)P(B)\neq P(B)P(A) $ because order of actions affects our judgment. (e.g., Gallup Opinion Poll) 
- **Sensitivity to Measurements**: Taking a measurement changes our mental state and therefore future behavior, despite no Bayesian updating.



Why QPT matters:
- It explains the confusions above with a common set of principles.
- It introduces novel concepts (e.g., incompatibility, superposition, collapse, entanglement, etc.)
- It introduces locality as the next step from CPT.
    - CPT exists only within small subsets of compatible questions. Across subsets, questions are incompatible.



## Basics
CPT vs QPT:
- CPT assumes a sample space with all possible outcomes.
    - A possible outcome is a subset of the sample space.
    - A possible outcome from a joint event is the intersection of subsets.
    - A person's beliefs are represented by a probability function that assigns a probability to each subset.
    - The probabilities assigned to the union of mutually exclusive events must add.
- QPT assumes a vector space with all possible outcomes.
    - All possible outcomes to an event are the unit vectors that form the axes.
    - Different events have different sets of axes obtainable via rotations.
    - A vector representing an event outcome spans a 1D subspace.
    - A person's beliefs are represented by a unit-length state vector.
    - The probability of an event outcome is obtained by projecting the state vector onto the corresponding subspace.
        - Hence, the order of events matter.

Key properties of QPT:
1. **Noncommutativity**: $ P(A,B)\neq P(B,A)$ ($\rightarrow $ Quantum Interference)
2. **Incompatibility**: Every time an event is resolved, the state vector changes, because of overlaps with both subspaces in the next event. ($ \rightarrow $ Vector Collapse)
    - $ A \& B$ are incompatible if the presence/outcome of $A$ alters our perspective of $B $.
    - In human words, it is often impossible to resolve all questions concurrently. Certainty about one event introduces uncertainty about others.
    - $ \rightarrow $ The eternal existence of uncertainty relations.
    - $ \rightarrow $ The impossibility of complete knowledge.
    - $ \rightarrow $ Cognition is strongly **context** and **perspective** dependent.
