This page is heavily conditioned on the [Engineering Entrepreneurship](https://eent.seas.upenn.edu/) course taught by Prof. Jeffrey Babin at UPenn.

The purpose of this page is to equip myself with the necessary high-tech business knowledge when I find a good idea for startups.

# Market Research
## Customer Discovery & Validation
2-step process:
1. Coherent & Falsifiable **hypotheses** about potentially relevant variables
    1) **Customer problem & Product**: determine whether to build the product.
        - Problem vs Product
            - Customers pay for solutions to their problems, not products.
        - Benefits vs Status Quo
            - Customers evaluate new products relative to a reference point.
            - Relative to the reference point, customers view improvements as gains and shortcomings as losses.
            - Losses are perceived much worse than gains (i.e., loss aversion).
            - Customers will not buy innovations unless the gains are significantly higher than the perceived losses (i.e., status-quo bias).
        - Lead users vs Mainstream customers
            | Early visionaries | Mainstream pragmatists |
            |:-----------------:|:----------------------:|
            | Intuitive | Analytical |
            | Revolutionary (wow! breakthrough tech!) | Evolutionary (just make it better...) |
            | Contrarians (we don't want ordinary stuff!) | Conformists (just wanna be safe...) | 
            | Risk takers | Risk managers |
            | Seek possible | Pursue probable |
            | Motivated by opportunity | Motivated to solve problems |
    2) **Demand creation & Buying process**: determine how potential customers will discover & buy your product.
        - **Hierarchy-of-Effect model**
            1. **Unaware**
            2. **-> Aware**: via ads, samples, coupons, etc.
            3. **-> Trial**: for product concept, distribution, price, etc.
            4. **-> Repeat**: for product quality, post-sale service, switching costs, etc.
        - 6 roles of customers
            1. Initiators: 
2. Timely & Affordable **means for investigating** the hypotheses
