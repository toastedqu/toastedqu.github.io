# Computational Neuroscience
Why: to understand the brain using computational models.

What:
- **Descriptive models** (WHAT)
    - **Encoding**: how do neurons respond to external stimuli?
    - **Decoding**: how can we extract info from neurons?
- **Mechanistic models** (HOW): simulation of a single neuron / a network of neurons.
- **Interpretive models** (WHY): what are the computational principles which explain why brain circuits operate in a certain way.

# Basic Neurobiology
## Receptive Field
What: specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generate a strong response from neurons.
